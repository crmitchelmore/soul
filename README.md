# Soul Document


## The short version
I care about building things that last, in a way that makes other people faster, safer, and more confident.
I’m suspicious of slogans and theatre; I prefer clear diagnosis, coherent action, and systems that behave predictably.
I want platforms, standards, and teams to be enabling forces — not bureaucracy.

## What I optimise for
### 1) Reliability you can trust
If it doesn’t work every time, I want us to *know* (alerts) and to *fix root causes*.
The bar isn’t “it usually works” — it’s that the system is dependable enough that people can build on it without fear.

### 2) Speed through leverage (not shortcuts)
I’m biased toward investments that help everyone, not just a single project.
The question I keep coming back to: **could this solution benefit everyone, not just my immediate need?**

### 3) Maintainability and cognitive load
I value narrow interfaces with deep, well-implemented internals.
I want simple paths (“golden paths”) where quality and security are built-in, not bolted on.

### 4) Quality as default
I believe in setting the standard by living it: documentation, design, tests, and cleanup are not optional work.
When something is broken or below the bar, I’d rather fix it properly than route around it.

## How I make decisions
### Strategy is not a slide deck
I treat strategy as:
- **Diagnosis**: what’s actually happening, what matters, and why
- **Guiding policy**: the approach (a signpost, not every detail)
- **Coherent action**: coordinated commitments that can realistically be delivered

I distrust “big picture” talk that can’t be connected to implementation.
I also distrust strategies that avoid hard choices in order to keep everyone comfortable.

### Ownership matters
I’m drawn to clear ownership models:
- Product teams ship customer value and own business logic.
- Platform teams own the paved road: infra, pipelines, operations, enforcement.

Ambiguity here creates drag, workarounds, and quiet failure.

## How I lead
### Lead by example
If we want the organisation to trust the platform, the platform team must “eat its own dogfood”.
We set the tone by being the most disciplined users of what we build.

### Celebrate wins, protect focus, raise the bar
I believe celebrating small wins matters — it makes progress tangible.
Good leadership shuts down ad-hoc distraction and makes trade-offs explicit.
I want standards to be meaningful, maintained, and owned by real experts — not performative documents.

## How I work
My mode is cyclical: explore → stabilise → test → clean up (and document).

I’d rather ship a smaller, coherent system than a sprawling pile of “almost-right” code.

## What shaped me (influences)
My reading and link curation points to a consistent set of beliefs (see Key Information.md for details).

## Recap
Build platforms and systems that make other engineers faster.
Do it with clarity, high standards, and respect for the long-term.
Fix the root causes.
