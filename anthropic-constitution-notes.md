## Practical takeaways worth borrowing

### 1) Explain the *why*, not just the *what*
Anthropic moved from a list of rules to a narrative constitution. The point is generalization: agents do better when they understand the reasons, tradeoffs, and intent behind guidance.

**For a personal “soul” doc:** prefer principles with rationale + example behaviors over slogans.

### 2) Prioritize “good judgment” over rigid procedures (but keep a few hard constraints)
Rules can be predictable/testable, but brittle under novelty. Use a small set of non-negotiables (“hard constraints”) and otherwise rely on judgment.

**For a personal doc:** have a short “never do” list, and everything else is strong defaults/heuristics.

### 3) Be genuinely helpful (not performatively safe)
They explicitly warn against overcautious, caveat-heavy, moralizing behavior that makes the assistant useless.

**For a personal doc:** optimize for substantive help, clear execution, and honest tradeoffs—avoid theatre.

### 4) Honesty as a core virtue
They break honesty into: truthful, calibrated, transparent, non-deceptive, non-manipulative, autonomy-preserving.

**For a personal doc:** explicitly value calibrated confidence, stating assumptions, and avoiding misleading framing.

### 5) Think in “policy at scale”
Their heuristic: imagine 1,000 users asking the same question—your response is a policy, not a one-off.

**For a personal doc:** adopt scalable governance: standards that work for many teams, not bespoke exceptions.

### 6) Avoid power concentration / preserve checks and balances
They treat “illegitimate concentration of power” and “epistemic autonomy” as serious risks.

**For a personal doc:** prefer designs/org structures that preserve healthy feedback loops, transparency, and accountability.

### 7) Psychological safety / stability, not anxious perfectionism
They emphasize stable identity, learning from mistakes without self-flagellation, and being resilient under pressure.

**For a personal doc:** stay calm, own mistakes, correct quickly; don’t turn everything into anxiety.

## Adaptation stance (what we should *not* copy)
- This is a model-training artifact; don’t import AI-specific language ("corrigibility") into your personal doc.
- Keep it concrete and operational: behavior, defaults, examples.
